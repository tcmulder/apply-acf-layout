Allows you to apply Advanced Custom Field flexible content layouts to pages.

== Description ==
Allows you to apply Advanced Custom Field flexible content layouts to pages. You can build these layouts as a Layouts custom post type and then apply them to as many posts as you'd like. For instance, if you have a common layout that you'd like to use for a Team custom post type that includes a headshot module, a bio module, and a contact details module, you can create that as a layout in this plugin's Layouts custom post type and name it Team Member Layout; then, when you're creating your individual Team posts, you can apply that Team Member Layout and the three modules will be populated on the page, ready for content.

* Creates a Layouts custom post type where you can build modular pages based on your own flexible content type.

* Allows you to apply those layouts to the posts on your site.

* You can either replace all content with the new layout, or append the layout under existing content in the post.

* Allows you to pick which flexible content field can be used for the layouts.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "apply-acf-layout" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
